# FrameFlow: A Dynamic Frame Sequence Animation Project

**FrameFlow** is an exciting project where I created dynamic frame sequence animations using a combination of modern web technologies. The project demonstrates a seamless integration of various tools and libraries to deliver smooth and visually engaging animations triggered by user interactions.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **HTML**: The foundation for structuring the content of the web page.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the project with efficiency and responsiveness in mind.
- **JavaScript**: The scripting language that powers the logic behind the animations.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A robust library used to create high-performance animations.
- **ScrollTrigger**: A GSAP plugin that allows animations to be triggered and controlled by scroll events.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration tools that make it easy to track changes and collaborate with others.

## üéØ Project Overview

In this project, I've implemented frame-by-frame animations that respond to user scrolling. As the user scrolls, the animation sequence plays, creating an immersive experience. The combination of GSAP and ScrollTrigger ensures that the animations are fluid and perfectly timed to user interactions.

## ü§ù Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Whether you have ideas for improving the animations, optimizing the code, or adding new features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Let's collaborate and make this project even better!
